## How this works
This site is built with HTML/CSS/Bootstrap, Python, and Jinja, a Python templating system. 

The logic lives in `utils.py` in the main `/blog` directory (which contains all the files/folders). 

## How to build this site

1. Clone/fork repo on your computer
2. Open interactive prompt: `python` if python2; `python3` if python3
3. `python manage.py` or `python3 manage.py` to build the site
